## Basics

- Run `npm run dev` from the commandline [^npmrundev] and open [`http://localhost:3000/`](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser.
- Create a "program" by composing some of the blocks.
- Go to `index.html` and change the title. Where do you see the effect?
- Go to `myFirstBlockly.js` and duplicate a block by changing the `toolbox`.
- Read https://developers.google.com/blockly/guides/create-custom-blocks/define-blocks#json
- Change the color of a block.

[^npmrundev]: See `package.json`.
